# Practical - 13

in this practical we have multiple projects so we have to chage the between so you have to change between them.

and here we used diffrent duffrent database so so you have to make the migrations for them.

befor the migartion you have to change the connection string in web config file accordign to your pc.

its okay youn can take the same name for database after that

so you have to fire the command in package manager console :

<strong> Update-Database </strong>

remember that you have to fire the update-databse command for all project and you have to update the connection string according to your pc.

if you get the same error as the beofr of roslyn than youi have to fire the same command as before which are shown below.

<string> Update-Package Microsoft.CodeDom.Providers.DotNetCompilerPlatform -r </strong>
